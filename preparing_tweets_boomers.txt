boomer question; why do all the youngsters/TikTok folks stick their tongue out in all their photos?

@conorsen @JHWeissmann Thinking about this more:  Boomer middle agewas “my kids are out of the house or not dictating my life as much” vs the millennial “alright, giving up a lot of my freedom for kids now”
@TOSportsAdam You started right off with the insults claiming I was a boomer etc. so don't play the victim card now because I can hit lower than you can. Typical beta behaviour. And yes you are right Nylander has even guys like Kassian looking over their shoulders and hearing footsteps. Bye

@tehuti1 @cache_pas I am deeply grateful to my Boomer mother for raising me with real feminism and never telling me certain things were off limits due to gender. She grew up without Title IX; no sports and not allowed to take math and science classes. The current generation has no idea.
It started with "OK Boomer" and I have since realized no one has any idea what ages apply to what generations.
